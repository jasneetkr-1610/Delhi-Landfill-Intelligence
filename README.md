# 🗑️ Delhi Landfill Intelligence

### *Turning Data into Awareness for a Cleaner Delhi*

**Delhi Landfill Intelligence** is a data-driven web platform that visualizes and communicates critical insights about Delhi’s landfill crisis.
The project transforms complex environmental information into a **clear, accessible, and engaging digital experience**, enabling awareness, understanding, and informed discussion around one of Delhi’s most pressing urban challenges.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Delhi is facing a severe landfill and waste-management crisis. Major landfill sites have exceeded their safe limits, leading to environmental degradation, health hazards, and long-term sustainability concerns.

Despite the seriousness of the issue:

* Data is difficult to understand for the general public
* Insights are scattered and poorly visualized
* Awareness remains limited

**Delhi Landfill Intelligence** bridges this gap by presenting landfill-related intelligence through an intuitive web interface.
The platform focuses on **clarity, visualization, and usability**, making environmental data understandable even for non-technical users.
